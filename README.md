# About This Project
I have Lot's of plans for this game but it is a labor of love so I may get board at some point and quit, but that isn't the case as of yet. In the game you can choose to be a Mage, Warrior, Archer or an Assassin. There will be weapons specific to a playing class and also weapons that two or all classes can use. The player will be able to level up and sell/buy item from NPC.
The map will be procedurally made so the seed will be able to share with friends so you may play the same map although it will not be Multiplayer. Multiplayer seems to be a bit far from my reach at the moment.

# In the Future
I think I would like to port this project over to pygame once its well established so it may be a 2d game at some point.
Also depends if I'm doing it alone or with some one. If I'm working on this project still and I'm by my self I'll try and make it in C# and Unity. I've never made a full program with C# nor have I made anything in unity so who knows. Maybe just make this game Multiplayer but thats for another time I suppose.
