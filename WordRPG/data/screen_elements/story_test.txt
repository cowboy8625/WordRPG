  Once upon a time, there was a peasant who, in spite of his poverty,

had a small farm, a vegetable garden and a single ox. His very

ramshackle farm was made of old boards of wood which mildewed. It

had two rooms. The first one was where, formerly, there was the shed

which could receive about ten oxen. Now there was only one left

because the peasant sold them all but one for a few pennies. The

second room was where the peasant slept, ate and washed. There

weren't many vegetable in the kitchen garden because the soil was

not fertile...
